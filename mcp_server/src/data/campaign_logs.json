Political intrigue unraveled as they uncovered betrayal from within Coralhymn itself. Restoring the pearl required not just battle, but diplomacy—and a test of loyalty beneath the waves. The party encounters an aboleth that had been manipulating the merfolk for its own gain, leading to a climactic underwater confrontation.",
